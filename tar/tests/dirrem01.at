# Description:
#
# When a directory in a deep directory disappeared during creation
# of incremental dump, tar <= 1.29 exits with TAREXIT_FAILURE (2).
#
# In case of files tar does not return TAREXIT_FAILURE, but instead
# it prints a warning and exits with TAREXIT_DIFFERS.
#
# This test checks whether this behaviour is mimicked for directories, too.

# Remark: This file is based on 'filerem01.at', which is the test-case for
# a vanishing file.
