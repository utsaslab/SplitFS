# Description:
# Restoring of directory modes and timestamps works correctly only
# if the archive has normal member ordering, i.e. each directory
# member is immediately followed by members located under that directory.
# This is not true for incremental archives, where directory members
# precede the non-directory ones. Due to this, GNU tar up to version 1.15.2
# failed to correctly restore directory timestamps from an incremental
# archive if this directory contained some files in it.

# dir/
# dir/subdir1/
# dir/subdir2/

# When restoring from this directory structure, 'dir/subdir2/' used to
# trigger apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat() which restored stats for
# 'subdir1' prior to restoring 'dir/subdir1/foofile'. Then, restoring the
# latter clobbered the directory timestamp.
