# Description: check --remove-files operation when archiving/deleting
# directory trees.
#
# This case checks the operation
# in --create/incremental mode.
#
# Note: in tar 1.27, when run in incremental mode tar will attempt to remove
# the directory before removing the files within that directory, and thus
# the --remove-files operation will cause tar to abort with an error status.
# This issue will be fixed in a later version of tar.
