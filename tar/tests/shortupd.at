# Fixing improper small file recognition in version 1.18 (see shortfile.at
# and ChangeLog:2007-08-24), introduced another bug: when updating a
# non-existing archive, tar-1.19 complained about its not being a tar archive
# and exited immediately, leaving the created zero-sized file after it.
#
# This bug was fixed on 2007-12-05.
