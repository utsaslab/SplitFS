# Description: when a file in a deep directory disappeared during creation
# of incremental dump, tar v. <1.23 would exit with TAREXIT_FAILURE (2).
# However, such events are quite common and don't necessarily constitute
# an error.  Exiting with code 2 in such cases makes it impossible to
# distinguish serious errors from benign ones.
#
# Starting from tar 1.22.90, tar exits with TAREXIT_DIFFERS (1)
# instead.
