# Description: When creating POSIX multivolume archives, tar may in
# some cases write an extended header at the end of one volume, and
# the corresponding ustar header at the beginning of the next volume.
# Such archives do not fully comply with the POSIX specs, but tar must
# be able to read them anyway. This is what this script tests.
#
# See function try_new_volume, in file src/buffer.c near line 1227
# for additional details.
