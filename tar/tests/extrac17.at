AT_SETUP([name matching/transformation ordering])
AT_KEYWORDS([extract extrac17 chdir])

# Description: Tar 1.24 changed the ordering of name matching and
# name transformation so that the former saw already transformed
# file names (see commit 9c194c99 and exclude06.at).  This reverted
# ordering made it impossible to match file names in certain cases.
# In particular, the testcase below would not extract anything.
