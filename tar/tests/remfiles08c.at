# Description: If tar 1.26 was called with the --remove-files option and told
# to archive (and thus delete) two subdirectories where the second was
# specified relative to the first, it would be unable to delete the
# second directory (and its contents), since the relative path would no
# longer be valid once the first directory was deleted.
#
# This case checks for successful deletion of all archived items
# in --append mode.
