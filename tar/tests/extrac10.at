# Check that delayed setting of directory metadata does not collide
# with the -C option.  When setting a directory's permissions, time
# stamps, etc., tar should apply the -C option that was in effect when
# the directory was extracted, not the -C option that happens to be in
# effect when the metadata are later set.
